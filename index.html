Development
 During the development of the Wii, The president of Nintendo Satoru Iwata directed the company to target a larger  demographic marketing to novice video game consumers instead of the hardcore audience. Shying a way from the traditional approach other game companies lead the Wii to becoming the highest bought console of the 2010's. During the infancy of the Wii which was developing under the code name Revolution. During this time Nintendo started to work with Gyration Inc. Which was firm that developed several patents related to motion detection. Over the next two years Satoru Iwata, who had been promoted to Nintendo's president in May 2002 following Hiroshi Yamauchi's retirement recognized that Nintendo had been lagging behind the competition. Nintendo had been struggling keeping up with trends in the video game industry, such as adapting to online gaming. He also thought Nintendo was becoming too  exclusive and wanted Nintendo to pursue gaming hardware and software that would appeal to all demographics. Nintendo's market  analysis discovered that their novel hardware had created consoles that made it difficult for third-party developers to create games for. This causing Nintendo to suffer. Miyamoto led the development of a new type of controller, based on Gyration's motion-sensing technology. Iwata proposed that this new console would use motion  sensing to simplify the gaming interface. The first prototype was finished in 6 months. In 2004 Iwata had finally released information to the public about this exciting new console.

The accelerometer allow the Wii to sense the controller with out the use of cords or wires. The infrared detectors are used to track the emissions from LEDs in the included Sensor Bar. Which need to be used for the remote to work. This gives the Wii remote the pointing ability like a computer mouse to the screen. The Wii remote has a range of 15 feet range for accurate detection. The remote also includes 4 buttons to control the system along with a power button to turn off the console. To power the controller itself two double A batteries are needed.
