    <h3 class="h">The Wii remote is the primary controller for the console. the remote has a MEMS-based three-dimension accelerometer, along with infrared detection sensors located at the far end of the controller. The accelerometer allow the Wii to sense the controller with out the use of cords or wires. The infrared detectors are used to track the emissions from LEDs in the included Sensor Bar. Which need to be used for the remote to work. This gives the Wii remote the pointing ability like a computer mouse to the screen. The Wii remote has a range of 15 feet range for accurate detection. The remote also includes 4 buttons to control the system along with a power button to turn off the console. To power the controller itself two double A batteries are needed. The controller connects to the console by Bluetooth. A speaker is on the controller and even a rumble pack. This pack allows the Controller to have vibrations. The controller went through a re-design in late 2010. This re-design makes the controller more accurate. A multitude of  accessors can be added to the controller to improve the quality of the controller.   </h3>
